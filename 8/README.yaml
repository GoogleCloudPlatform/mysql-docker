      A recommended way to start up your MySQL server is to have the root
      password generated as a onetime password. You will then log on and
      change this password. MySQL will not fully function until this onetime
      password is changed.

      Instead of the explicit password string, a file path can also be used,
      in which case the content of the file is the password.
  - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
    description: Optionally specifies the name of the database to be created at startup.
  - name: MYSQL_USER
    description: >-
      Optionally specifies a new user to be created at startup.
      Must be used in conjunction with `MYSQL_PASSWORD`. Note that this
      user is in addition to the default `root` superuser.
      <br><br>
      If `MYSQL_DATABASE` is also specified, this user will be granted
      superuser permissions (i.e. `GRANT_ALL`) for that database.
  - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
    description: Used in conjunction with `MYSQL_USER` to specify the password.
  - name: MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD

    description: >-
      If set to `yes`, the initial password for `root` superuser, be it
